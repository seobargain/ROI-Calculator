- • **Productivity** - Valued employees are more likely to offer discretionary effort, meaning you experience a boost in productivity and efficiency if a successful recognition programme is put in place.
- • **Lost productivity** - High employee turnover will also create lost productivity. This can be due to timely recruitment processes or paused employee replacements, plus new hires can take 1-2 years before they reach optimum productivity.
- • **Disengagement** - Gallup research suggests only 15% of the global workforce is engaged. And, a disengaged employee costs the business 34% of their salary.
- • **Total investment** - If you want to include financial rewards in your recognition programme, chat to us about building it into your plan and how it could impact ROI.
- • **Wider business impact** - There are other areas within the business that will be impacted by recognition, so be sure to assess areas including employee satisfaction, onboarding reviews and engagement survey scores.
- • **Employee benefits** - Recognition can be combined employee benefits to create an enhanced employee value proposition.
